## Notes

This particular episode is a panel discussion with a very controversial title \"Rx Must Die\".As you might know, all hosts of The Context podcast have very warm feelings about Rx and it was not an easy job for us to comment, Hannes and Artur were strong enough but Artem had to bail out (oof). We hope you enjoy this episode and find things to think about, remember if you want to discuss them â€” we have discussions on GitHub (link above)!

Thanks droidcon Berlin and the local Berlin Android community for collaborating with us.
